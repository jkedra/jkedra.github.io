## 7 Habits of Being Effective
When I saw first 10 minutes of [7 Habits For Effective Text Editing 2.0],
by Brian Moolenaar, I immediately realized it was the best way to
spent 10 minutes in the last month. It struck me I was not aware
of so basic features of vim!
Sure I know a lot about it, but I didn't know fundamental commands!

The rest of the talk was not as good so I recommend to see at least
the beginning of it. Maybe you will like the rest as well. 
But if you don't have time, here is what I found there:

### Search
Something we do the most often. This is why it is worth to get
more than familiar on this topic. Good start is to read vim's documentation
on the subject: `:help search-commands`.

The basic search skill is to be aware of `:set hlsearch` and be able to
use it with a star command `*`. The star and its derivatives (`#`,`g*`,...)
allow to find the word you have near the cursor.

### Code Completion
It works out of the box! Once you write a complex method name,
vim is aware of it and next time vim may help you with autocompleting it.
Just start typing a few letters of the workd you have written before,
then press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>N</kbd>
and vim does autocomplete - if you are lucky. If you are not - press the
shortcut a couple of times until you hit the proper name.

## Other hints
As many others when I am stuck I reach for [stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com)
to find answers. And I usually do. Below are my findings.

### Stats
Q: I want to see numbers of characters I have highlighted.
My VIM does not do it out of the box.

A: But [people say](http://superuser.com/questions/289264/count-highlighted-string-length-in-vim)
it already has such the capability and it is as simple as
highlighting a block with <kbd>v</kbd> and typing
<kbd>g</kbd> <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>g</kbd>.
It works great.

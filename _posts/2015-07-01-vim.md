I want to see numbers of characters I have highlighted.
My VIM does not do it out of the box.
But [people say](http://superuser.com/questions/289264/count-highlighted-string-length-in-vim)
it already has such the capability and it is as simple as
highlighting a block with `v` and typing `g CTRL-g`.
It works great.

I was about to write the <abbr title="Bourne Shell Again">Bash</abbr> is a
swiss-army knife for unix administrator, but I should write is for all
professional unix users.

Below you may find a few cool features which took my attention recently.

## Recent Discoveries

### $CDPATH

       CDPATH The  search  path for the cd command.  This is a colon-separated
              list of directories in which the shell looks for destination di‐
              rectories  specified  by  the  cd  command.   A  sample value is
              ".:~:/usr".

Here is how I setup it: I created `$HOME/cdpath` directory where symbolically
linked all the most frequently used directories. Then I added the following
entry to my `.bashrc`:

{% highlight bash %}
    CDPATH=.:~/cdpath
    set -o physical # show physical path instead default logical
{% endhighlight %}

Now, wherever on the filesystem I am, I do not have to type a full path
of my favourite directory because they are all searched at the content
of `CDPATH` variable, which is current dir and `~/cdpath`:

    jxa@ub22:0:~$ pwd
    /home/jxa
    jxa@ub22:0:~$ cd jekyl
    /home/jxa/cdpath/jekyl
    jxa@ub22:0:~/GIT/jkedra.github.io$ 

Also, by default `pwd` command is bash internal one and by default
it presents the _logical_ path (show symbolic links) which is visible
here as `/home/jxa/cdpath/jekyl`. Since I prefer the _physical_ full path
instead, I may use `/usr/bin/pwd` which has opposite defaults or - luckily -
there is a way to change bash standar behaviour with `set -o physical`:


    pwd [-LP]
          Print  the  absolute  pathname of the current working directory.
          The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the -P option
          is supplied or the -o physical option to the set builtin command
          is enabled.  If the -L option is used, the pathname printed  may
          contain  symbolic links.  The return status is 0 unless an error
          occurs while reading the name of the current directory or an in‐
          valid option is supplied.


### Return Value

I found it to be usefull to have an immediate feedback about the
recent command status in the prompt as seen in Visual Studio Code:

![prompt-vc <>]({{"/img/prompt-vc.png" | absolute_url}})

I could not to do have as nice as VSC has but was able to squeeze
the return status in the textual way, which is even more informative.
See for the `?:` which has been added in the both `PS1` variables:

{% highlight bash %}
if [ "$color_prompt" = yes ]; then
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:$?:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
else
    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:$?:\w\$ '
fi
{% endhighlight %}

And here is the result:

    jxa@ub22:0:~$ false
    jxa@ub22:1:~$ sss
    Command 'sss' not found, but there are 17 similar ones.
    jxa@ub22:127:~$ 

In a different way than VSC does, the last status is set in the next prompt.



## Readline

### [Moving Commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Movement-Commands.html#Readline-Movement-Commands)

<kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd> Move forward a word.<br>
<kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>b</kbd> Move backward a word.

### [Killing Commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Killing-Commands.html#Readline-Killing-Commands)

Killed/yanked/cut-and-pasted content is saved in a _kill-ring_.

<kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>k</kbd>  Kill the text from the cursor to the end of line.<br>
<kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>d</kbd>  Kill the text from the cursor to the end of word.
<kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>DEL</kbd> Kill the text from the cursor to the start of the word.
                            I do not see it working at Ubuntu.<br>
<kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>w</kbd>   Kill the text from the cursor to the previous whitespace.


<kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>y</kbd> Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.<br>
<kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>y</kbd> Rotate the kill-ring and yank the new top. You can do it only after <kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>y</kbd>

### Other Commands

Readline key bindings can be printed in bash using `bind -P`.

[Bindable Readline Commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bindable-Readline-Commands.html#Bindable-Readline-Commands)

_edit-and-execute-command_ (<kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>-<kbd>e</kbd>) - invokes an editor and executes the typed-in command.<br>

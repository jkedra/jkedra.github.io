Jekyll automatically regenerates all changed files into
a target directory `_site`. However it does not regenerate
a file referencing another file which has just changed.

It has been particularly painful for `index.html` file where
I reference a list of posts in a following loop:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  <li>
    <span class="post-meta">
       {{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}
       ({{ post.language | capitalize }})
    </span>
    <h2>
      {% assign is_draft = (post.path | truncate: 6, "") %}
      {% if is_draft == "_draft" %} {% assign class_post_link = "post-link-draft" %}
      {% else %} {% assign class_post_link = "post-link" %}
      {% endif %}
      <a class="{{ class_post_link }}"
         href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </h2>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, I keep a list of files in `_drafts` folder, they have no date specified,
neither as a part of the filename nor in the YAML front matter. Jekyll updates
their filenames with the current date when their content changes. But then
it does not regenerate `index.html`. So far I forced the regeneration by
`touch index.html` file, but did not seem to be neat solution I was searching for.

Much better approach is to add `regenerate: true` to my `index.html`
YAML front matter. It forces the file to be included in each rebuild.
And it happens automatically. 

I found it described at Jekyll's GitHub Project, as a merge of
[Incremental Regeneration](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/3116),
and it is also referenced at the original
[Jekyll's Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/).

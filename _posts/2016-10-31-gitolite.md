[Gitolite](http://gitolite.com) is a missing puzzle with git toolset.
It was a great discovery because until I found it I had hard time
to sort out access privileges to git repositories. It is simple
solution with aesthetic interface and privileges. Also well tested in
practice because is used by kernel.org. But devil is in the detail.
Once a list of my repositories grow, access privileges complicate.
And I have recently wasted well over an hour of my time which I had
to spend figuring out how its access control system really works.

## Permissions

In its principles it is enough to work with just a couple of
[basic permissions](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/conf.html#the-permission-field)
like R (read), [RW](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/conf.html#write-types)
(R + create/fastforward/push a ref) and RW+ (RW + rewind/delete a ref).
The - (minus sign) removes an access.

There are some other other permissions like D/C/M which I was not
interested in yet.

## Gitolite Access Check Flow

The config file is parsed from top to bottom. But there is one more thing -
there are [two different flows][two flows]:
**Flow #1** for read only operations (R - fetch, clone), and **flow #2** for
changes (RW+). Normally the read access does not respect deny rules.
There is an option to change that but by default read only access discards all
- (deny) rules. Here is [an example][access-control] how it works.

{% highlight text linenos=table %}

repo testing
    RW+         = jxa
    -    master = aga
    RW+ dev/    = aga
    RW          = aga

{% endhighlight %}

In the example above user `jxa` has all access to all branches, including
delete/rewind. User `aga` has all possible privileges to do anything with
branches starting with `dev/`, for branches not starting with `dev/`, `aga` may
create and fast forward, but not rewind nor delete. For the `master` read
access (clone, pull) shall be granted (because of flow #1), but all other
privileges revoked.

However it did not work with my testing procedures.
See below how I test it.

## Testing

I found it comfortable to test directly at the server. Gitolite documentation
mentions [`gitolite access`](http://gitolite.com/gitolite/conf.html#tracing-the-access-control-decision) command. Here is its syntax:

{% highlight XML %}
   gitolite access [-q|-s] <repo> <user> <perm> <ref>
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of changing the `gitolite.conf` at remote git repository,
commiting and pushing it to the git server - I choose to edit the file
at the server, usually it is `$HOME/.gitolite/conf/gitolite.conf`.
It needs to be compiled after any change by `gitolite compile`.

## Unexpected Results

So I had to spend more time to figure out why it works differently than
what was described above and is written in the documentation. Below we follow
a scenario where user `aga` requests fetch/clone access to `master`
branch.

{% highlight text %}

git@aws4:~/.gitolite/conf$ gitolite access -s testing aga R master
legend:
    d => skipped deny rule due to ref unknown or 'any',
    r => skipped due to refex not matching,
    p => skipped due to perm (W, +, etc) not matching,
    D => explicitly denied,
    A => explicitly allowed,
    F => denied due to fallthru (no rules matched)

  D        gitolite.conf:3          -    master = aga

R refs/heads/master testing aga DENIED by refs/heads/master
git@aws4:~/.gitolite/conf$ 

{% endhighlight %}

According to our rules, `aga` should be granted fetch/clone to `master`,
because flow #1 [ignores deny rules][access-control] and grants access
in line number 5. So gitolite does not behave as described.

Let's check another scenario, instead of naming a particular branch
we may use word `any` to test an access to unspecified brach.

{% highlight text %}

git@aws4:~/.gitolite/conf$ gitolite access -s testing aga R any
legend:
    d => skipped deny rule due to ref unknown or 'any',
    r => skipped due to refex not matching,
    p => skipped due to perm (W, +, etc) not matching,
    D => explicitly denied,
    A => explicitly allowed,
    F => denied due to fallthru (no rules matched)

  d        gitolite.conf:3          -    master = aga
  A        gitolite.conf:4          RW+ dev/    = aga

refs/heads/dev/
git@aws4:~/.gitolite/conf$ 

{% endhighlight %}

This time `access` tool explicitely skips the deny rule of line 3 and
grants access based on the line 4, because as I presume, `any` means
any branch, `dev` including. This kind of testing with `any` does not
look useful at first glance. But it is actually useful, just follow my
path and look what I have found:

{% highlight text %}
git@aws4:~/.gitolite/conf$ less ~/bin/commands/access
[...]

Notes:
    [...]
    The 'any' ref is special -- it ignores deny rules, thus simulating
    gitolite's behaviour during the pre-git access check (see 'deny-rules'
    section in rules.html for details).

{% endhighlight %}

Why did they hide it here? Indeed it matches flow #1 definition - it is supposed
to ignore all deny rules and all [refexes][refex].

## Wrap Up

So actually the `gitolite access` utility works as designed but we have to
test it twice: once for write access, and another one for read access
using `any` as the branch name.

Another motion - the documentation is usually poor,
check the source code by yourself.

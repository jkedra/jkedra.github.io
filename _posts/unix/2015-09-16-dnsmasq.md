I want to run a couple of apache virtual websites
at my Ubuntu 14.04LTS laptop. It has not bind/named
installed but to my surprise in `/etc/resolv.conf`
there is a reference to `127.0.0.1`.
It means something bind like is running at my machine.
It turned out to be [dnsmasq](we:Dnsmasq)!
It has been installed along with Ubuntu
[Network Manager](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager).

Dnsmasq indeed is a cache and it has quite powerfull capabilities like
defining local DNS entries in `/etc/hosts` and return them as DNS responses.
This is exactly what I wanted. This way I could run a list of local sities
with apache httpd. Unfortunately when dnsmasq is called by NetworkManager,
it by default ignores `/etc/hosts` and there is no configuration to be tuned. 

After a short digging in the web, I found a dirty hack which replaces
`dnsmasq` binary with a script and this way allows to consider entries
from `/etc/hosts` to be valid DNS records.
The other option is to get dnsmasq out of NetworkManager control and
install it independently.

Both solutions
[are described here](https://gist.github.com/magnetikonline/6236150).

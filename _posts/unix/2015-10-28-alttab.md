Ubuntu's unity really drives me crazy with its default
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> behaviour. Unity organizes
terminals in groups. So when I want to switch to another
terminal, first I have to choose the group, wait a while
and then make a second choice to pick a proper terminal.
Usually switching often between just two or three termianls
the current mode is a huge time-waster.

My level or annoyance finally reached a level which pushed me
to seek a solution at [StackExchange][stack]. And there are indeed some
solutions. First is to switch over the current group by using
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>~</kbd>. So far it works quite well for me.
The new way of switching can be deactivated fully as well by using 
CompizConfig Settings Manager. Just follow [this link][compiz].

Walking over AWS services is quite interesting review of technologies currently wide used on the Internet:

## Cache ##

*  [Memcached](http://memcached.org/about), _allows you to take memory
   from parts of your system where you have more than you need
   and make it accessible to areas where you have less than you need_.

## AWS CloudFormation ##

* [Troposphere](https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere)
* [CloudFormation Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R44BADNJA8)
* <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html>

## Why Markdown?
I like [Markdown](we:) because it is lightweight, simple, and readable. It has
minimal requirements, can be edited by a simple editor ([vim] is enough)
and it can be edited quickly. It is readably in any platform by any tool. It is
ubiquitous, supported by [Jekyll], [Github] Pages, and PHP. It is heavy in terms
of information and small with a file size. Still it has also features of its
heavier brothers like TeX, HTML and PDF.

It has its limitations though: Not such flexible as HTML is, comes in many
flavors -- most of them supporting only a limited set of features. There is
Markdown of [DaringFireball] which is pretty raw, limited version. There are
extensions of [PHP][phpE], [Python][PythonE], and [Pandoc][PandocE].

It also has strong competitor: [Textile] -- which has similar features and comes
much farther in a field of flexibility, allowing to specify CSS properties
directly.

## Pandoc
If not Pandoc I would not write this post. Truth is, recently I started to be
sick of Markdown because of all its limitations. There were PHP and Python
extensions but not easy to use. A few days ago I really needed to write a
document and since there was no MS Word around, but only Linux available, I
decided to give a go for Markdown. Truth is I find rather distracting to use
sopthisticated tools just for a simple task.

As a first try I started searching some plugins for Chromium and Firefox. It
would be nice to write some text, cut-and-paste to browser and click a button to
make it a nice HTML. Indeed there is something like that for Firefox (Markdown
converter for Gmail) but I was not satisfied enough. In the next attempt I did
search through `apt-cache` and that time found something promising: `pandoc`. It
tempted me by its simplicity and a possiblity to convert, from and to, multiple
formats. Not just Markdown itself but plain text, epub, pdf, LaTeX, RTF, groff
and many others. Although this is Markdown which seems to be the central feature
of `pandoc`. But what really captured me is wide spread of Markdown features.
The native Pandoc Markdown has quite nice implementation of Markdown tables and
lists -- in my opinion the weakest points of raw Markdown. And this is just what
the top of the iceberg, there is much more added in comparision to raw Markdown.

## VIM

### Table Mode
There is an awesome table creator: [VIM Table Mode][vimtable]. I spent an hour
playing with it. By installing it I found also a couple of other interesting
plugins at github.

### Markdown Syntax
To my surprise VIM does not support Markdown out of the box. At least it does
not look nice. There are multiple extensions present at Github and I started
with [this one][vimmd1] and I found it satifactory.

## Summary
Pandoc has really nice implementation of Markdown. Jekyll's standard
implementation is limited to Github's implementation. And you cannot change it
as long as you want to live at Github Pages. So I did not experiment with other
Jekyll extensions for Markdown.

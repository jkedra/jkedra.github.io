HTML evolved a lot since last time I learned it. So this is a time to review
what has changed since then.

## What is new, what is removed in HTML5?

* [HTML4 to HTML5 migration](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_migration.asp) -
  a great comparison and article about HTML5.
* [HTML Canvas Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/canvas/default.asp)
* [SVG tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/svg/default.asp)


### Deprecated.
In older HTML versions, several tags and attributes were used to style documents.
These tags and attributes are not supported in HTML5!

Deprecated tags are: <qq>font</qq>, <qq>center</qq>, and <qq>strike</qq>.
Avoid using the color and bgcolor attributes.

### Charset
There are differences with charset declaration.

For HTML4:
{% highlight html %}
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=ISO-8859-1">
{% endhighlight %}

For HTML5:
{% highlight html %}
<meta charset="UTF-8">
{% endhighlight %}

### New
[What is new](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) at w3schools.

## Website Layout
HTML5 offers new semantic elements to support website layout.
More details on [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp).

Yes, the layout is rather broad subject but this is about HTML5.
It is enough to say it has introduced following tags to clarify and
support page layout. The following tags are now available:

header |description
-------|----------
nav    |container for navigation links
-------|----------
section|section in a document
-------|-----------------
article|an idependent self-contained article
-------|-----------------
aside  |content aside from the content (a sidebar)
-------|-----------------
footer |for the document or section
-------|-----------------
details|additional details
-------|-----------------
summary|heading for details element

## Tables enhancement

{% assign ary = 'caption colgroup col thead tbody tfoot' | split:" " %}
I am not sure if it is HTML5 which introduced tags
like {% for item in ary %} <qq>{{ item }}</qq>, {% endfor %}
but I do not recall seeing them in HTML before.
They are briefly described by [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).

## &lt;q&gt; for short quotation
Still I am not sure if it is new in HTML5 -- but it is new to me.

{% highlight css %}
/* open and closing quotes like in polish */
Q       { quotes: "\201E" "\201D" }
Q:before        { content: open-quote }
Q:after         { content: close-quote }

/* quotes like << >> (IE may lag) */
Q1      { quotes: "\00AB" "\00BB" }
Q1:before       { content: open-quote }
Q1:after        { content: close-quote }
{% endhighlight %}

And results:

<p><Q>Open and closed quotes.</Q></p>
<p><Q1>Using an extra tag (Q1) here we have an << >> quotes.</Q1></p>


### &lt;mark&gt; for marking
{% highlight html %}
Not marked. <mark>Marked.</mark> Not marked.
{% endhighlight %}

Results:
<p>Not marked. <mark>Marked.</mark> Not marked.</p>


### &lt;abbr&gt; for abbreviation
{% highlight html %}
 <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

Results:
<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

## Forms
I was also not aware of <qq>fieldset</qq> and <qq>legend</qq> tags.
When were they introduced? It was not HTML5 which added them.
More details on [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp).

 <form action="#">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Personal information:</legend>
    First name:<br>
    <input type="text" name="firstname" value="Mickey">
    <br>
    Last name:<br>
    <input type="text" name="lastname" value="Mouse">
    <br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </fieldset>
</form> 

<br>
There are other tags, HTML5 specific, like datalist, keygen, output.
The tag [<qq>output</qq>](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp)
seems to be particularly interesting
because it allows to create highly interactive pages.

HTML5 added [several new input types](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp):

* color ![FF](/img/firefox.gif)![CH](/img/chrome.gif)
* date  ![nFF](/img/nofirefox.gif)![CH](/img/chrome.gif)
* datetime ![nFF](/img/nofirefox.gif)![nCH](/img/nochrome.gif)
* datetime-local ![nFF](/img/nofirefox.gif)![CH](/img/chrome.gif)
* email ![FF](/img/firefox.gif)
* month
* number
* range ![FF](/img/firefox.gif)![CH](/img/chrome.gif)
* search
* tel
* time
* url ![FireFox](/img/firefox.gif)
* week

There are also new input restrictions added.
[W3schools has details](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp).

Input fields can have [various attributes](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp)
like value (initial value), readonly, disabled, size (in chars), maxlength.
HTML5 has added a long list of attributes and among interesting are
pattern (regexp to validate a field), placeholder, required.

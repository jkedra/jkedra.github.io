Hello friend and thank you for reaching my page.

</script> old, I enjoy various activities, listed below:

1. [Sailing](/sail).
2. Climbing (<script>document.write(moment([2017,03]).fromNow(true));</script>).
3. Riding a motorcycle (<script>document.write(moment([2014,09]).fromNow(true));</script>) and a bike (a long time).
4. Doing HAM radio (<script>document.write(moment([2004,06]).fromNow(true));</script>) but now limited to Morse code activities (<script>document.write(moment([2021,03]).fromNow(true));</script>).

Hello friend and thank you for reaching my page.

My name is Jurek, I am

       document.write(moment([1973,11]).fromNow(true));
</script> old. I am blessed to have a loving wife and three grown kids.

I enjoy various activities, listed below:

1. [Sailing](/sail).
2. Climbing (<script>document.write(moment([2017,03]).fromNow(true));</script>).
3. Riding a motorcycle (<script>document.write(moment([2014,09]).fromNow(true));</script>) and a bike (a long time).
4. Doing HAM radio (<script>document.write(moment([2004,06]).fromNow(true));</script>) but now limited to Morse code activities (<script>document.write(moment([2021,03]).fromNow(true));</script>).
5. Digital and analog electronics.

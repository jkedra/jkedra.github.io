Some time ago, while reading documentation about Flask I came across of mysterious decorators.
Reading Python docs and wikipedia article did not help too much
and left me with a statement it is just a "syntactic sugar" which
did not answer my question on how decorators work. So I put it aside
for later. I recall this fact recently
and browsed Internet on the subject of python's decorators.
And what I found is an excellent post
["Python Decorators in 12 Steps"](http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/python-decorators-in-12-steps/).
It gave me a solid understanding what decorators are exactly

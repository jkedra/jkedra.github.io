"Must Have" is only a catch phrase. Actually I list here tools

1. [IPython](http://ipython.org) - a powerfull interactive shell with
    [multiple features][ip-shell-feat].
    * [IPython shell tutorial][ip-tut]

    `ipython3 --help-all`

2. [The Definitive Guide to Setup Python Workspace][pyworksp]

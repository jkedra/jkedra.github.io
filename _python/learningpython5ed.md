### Intro
Almost every time I start learning a new language from a book 
(C, Python included), I face lack of basic info about initial environment
creation. It is very frustrating because instead of learning
an actual language, I struggle with installing a compiler,
tools, and finding an appropriate editor plugins or IDE.

Here it is quite different with Mark's Lutz book. First 100 pages,
not only give you extensive info about Python origins but
also a hand with configuring the environment you need.

### MS Windows bias
Obviously Mark openly admits, it is MS Windows which is his
OS when it comes to writing and running Python. It influences
his tools knowledge and information he presents. I am reading
this book in late 2015 and still it looks up to date. But when
it comes to Linux tools, he seems to ignore some of them.

#### Editor
He describes at least the one I use: Spyder - Scientific PYthon Development
EnviRonment. Not an editor really, it is an IDE.

I am more enthusiasitic than Python professional. But I did a short analysis
about which tool would be an appropriate editor for Python. Spyder then was the
best candidate I found.

### Still Reading

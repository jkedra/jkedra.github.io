A lot of people choose Windows and Mac because of vast number of good quality
software available for these operating systems. Linux is rather associated
with ms-dos like text windows. Actually there is a lot of good software
already available. Here is a list of Ubuntu/Linux graphics software:

1. [Gimp] - multilayer photo/image editor (`apt install gimp`)
2. [Inkscape] - vector drawing program, pretty advanced (`apt install inkscape`)
3. [Pinta] - simple image editor, Paint like (`apt install pinta`)

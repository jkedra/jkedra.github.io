brew update
brew upgrade readline

Python has been installed as
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/bin/pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python3.8/site-packages

python@3.8 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have python@3.8 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile

For compilers to find python@3.8 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/include"

For pkg-config to find python@3.8 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.8/lib/pkgconfig"



WARNING: The Python readline extension was not compiled. Missing the GNU readline lib?

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/1479#issuecomment-610683526

This is a larger issue. pyenv should ignore linuxbrew entirely.
If it doesn't import _curses will fail, causing a lot of libraries to stop working.

I tried manually editing out the homebrew readline usage from my local python-build. But _curses was still broken.
Then I re-exported my PATH without linuxbrew, reinstalled my python version, and everything worked like a charm.

# Save so we can revert
OLD_PATH="$PATH"
# Remove linuxbrew from the path
export PATH="$(echo $PATH | tr : '\n' | grep -v linuxbrew | paste -s -d:)"
# Install Python
pyenv install 3.8.2
# revert path
export PATH=$OLD_PATH

==> python@3.9
Python has been installed as
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin

You can install Python packages with
  pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
  /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/lib/python3.9/site-packages

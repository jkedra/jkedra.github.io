At [Ubuntu](we:Ubuntu_(operating_system)) 16.04
there are two entries to activate Desktop Zoom.
One tool is [Unity Tweak Tool](we:),
another is [CompizConfig Settings Manager](we:).

In Compiz there is a plugin _Ehnanced Zoom Desktop_ (section _Accessiblity_),
which looks quite powerfull.

    service lightdm restart

- I'm gonna put you in I.T.
  Because you said on your CV you had a lot of experience with computers.

- I did say that on my CV yes.
  I have lots of experience with the whole...
  computer... thing you know,
  e-mails...
  sending e-mails,
  receiving e-mails,
  deleting e-mails...

  ... I could go on.

- Do!

- The Web...
  Using mouse...
  mices...
  using mice.
  Clicking...
  double clicking...
  the computer screen of course, the keyboard...
  the... bit that goes on the floor down there...

- The hard drive?

- Correct.

- Well, you certainly seem to know your stuff.
  That settles. Got a good feeling about you Jen!
  And they need a new manager.

- Oh fantastic!
   So... the people I'll be working with, what're they like?

- Standard nerds!

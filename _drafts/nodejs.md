## How to start

I tried to start with NodeJS in the past but it did not attract me.
Hopefully I failed because I tried to learn it by myself. Now I am
starting with [Udemy Course][1] - so I expect it to be more successfully
attempt this time.

## Ubuntu Install

First install nodejs, but not like [the course][1] says (it mentions
global install for Mac and Windows), but rather using [this tutorial][2](16.04)
or [this one][3](18.04).

### [It's okay to not want a promotion](https://medium.com/s/powertrip/its-okay-to-not-want-a-promotion-1f7bcb98ef6e)

[...]  I wanted to be someone who did a corporate job with competence to support the other things I wanted to do in my life. That meant having health insurance, traveling to spend time with my family, and writing things that I wanted to write without having to worry if the writing would pay the bills.

Some might say I was overqualified for my next job. But it was the perfect role for me. It required a pay cut, but it didn’t require me to give anything beyond what I was comfortable giving: my attention for 40 hours a week, with comfortable lunch breaks. I went home in the evening with a spring in my step and enough mental energy to write and publish a book. A previous boss once suggested that I take a sabbatical to have time to find a partner (an insane idea that, under the circumstances, actually felt like a reasonable suggestion). At this new job, I had time to meet someone and fall in love and get married. When people celebrated “big wins” and clapped each other on the back for “crushing it,” I just sat there and smiled. I knew that I’d never be a big fish in their sea. I’d poured out that cup of ambition. And I had never, ever felt so powerful at work.

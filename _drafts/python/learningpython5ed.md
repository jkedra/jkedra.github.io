### Intro
Nearly every time I started learning from a book a new language
(C, Python included), I faced lack of basic info about initial environment
creation. It was very frustrating because instead of learning
an actual language, I was struggling with installing a compiler,
tools, and finding an appropriate editor plugins or IDE.

Here it is quite different with Mark Lutz book. Initial 100 pages,
give you not only extensive info about Python origins but
also give you a hand with configuring the environment you need.

### MS Windows bias
Obviously Mark openly admits, it is MS Windows which is his
OS when it comes to writing and running Python. It influences
his tools knowledge and information he presents. I am reading
this book in late 2015 and still it looks up to date. But when
it comes to Linux tools, he seems to ignore some of them.

#### Editor
At least the one I use: Spyder - Scientific PYthon Development EnviRonment.

I am not Python professional, but rather enthusiastic. But I did
a short analysis about which tool would be an appropriate editor
for Python. Spyder was the best candidate I found then.

### Still Reading
